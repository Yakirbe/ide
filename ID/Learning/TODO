***************************** TODO ***************************** 

6. You need to create IDgroupsPair so that you'll be able to embed two points with it.
You need to use GridsOfGroups for it.

9. symmetry: IDgroupsPair should be symmetric 
(You need to change Alex code so that IDgroupsPair will get an input if it is symmteric or not).

11. Add a private function that computes the whole loss.

12. Add google test for SGD_ID_pairs_similarity

**************************************************************** 




***************************** ask Ofir *************************

Utils.hpp ->	* transposeMatToVec() - did you ask for it? 
				* nextCombination() - not in use, can i delete it? in use createPairCombinations() instead.
				* check findDiscretePoints()
				* can i make "number_of_chunks" a constant field of Utils class?
Learning.hpp->	* which is better std::rand()?


**************************************************************** 






add flag for multi-core machines when OpenMP is enabled in your compiler -fopenmp







***************************** Done ***************************** 

1. Put your code in Learning folder and Alexey code:
http://www.ariel.ac.il/sites/ofirpele/ID/ID-1.zip
In an ID folder and include the ID stuff from ../ID/ 

2. I changed the name of the Learning class and changed the name of the function to operator() and made it static. 
Make everything else there static and private except classifcation which you should change to classify and public static.

3. I removed _W, just pass W as a paramter

4. Don't use variables such as W_size. Just use W.size() isntead

5. I removed the tags, just use labels which are -1 for similar and +1 for Unsimilar for now.

7. if_equal_dist_zero: if the samples are exactly the same W_reg should be zero and W should be zero.

8. if_non_equal_dist_non_zero: if samples are not exactly the same W_reg and W should be at least NON_EQUAL_EPSILON,

10. Where is find_discrete_points?
